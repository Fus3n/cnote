        Note: 
            This is the last Update as my Project got merged with old updates and didn't had any backup and also git settings are gone from vs studio so cant revert The Binary is Marked as Debug From Vs Studio and couldn't complete some update so it might not be very stable And if 
            you see Any Windows Warning don't worry its a false Positive just click More Info And Run Anyway this is 64 bit only as I didn't had any other binary backup.
